    <h2>What exactly are psychedelics?</h2>
        <p>Psychedelics are defined to be a class of <span data-descr="affecting the mind">psychoactive</span> substances that produce changes in perception, mood and cognitive processes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Psychedelics affect all the senses, altering someone's thinking, sense of time and emotions. They can also cause a person to hallucinateâ€”seeing or hearing things that do not exist or are distorted.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What are the different types of psyches?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> <span data-descr="Lysergic Acid Diethylamide">LSD</span> is created from a substance found in ergot, a fungus that infects rye.</li>
            <li> <span data-descr="a hallucinogenic alkaloid, found in some toadstools">Psilocybin</span> is a naturally occurring substance found in mushrooms and is found in many parts of the world.</li>
            <li>Mescaline is derived from the Mexican peyote and San Pedro cactus and produces similar effects to LSD.</li>
            <li> <span data-descr="Diemethyltryptamine">DMT</span> is structurally similar to <span data-descr="an alkaloid found in psilocybin mushrooms">psilocin.</span> It can be synthesized in the laboratory but is also a naturally occurring component of several plants.</li>
            <li> <span data-descr="4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine">2C-B</span> is a psychedelic drug first synthesize in 1974.

            <li> <span data-descr="Lophophora Williamsii">Peyote</span> is the most well-known and potent psychedelic cactus, although the smallest and slowest growing. Instead of growing upward to form a column, it grows as 'buttons' low to the ground. It has been utilized by Native Americans for over 5000 years. </li>
            <li> <span data-descr="N-methoxybenzyl">25[-x]-NBOMe</span> is the name for a series of drugs that have psychedelics effects. Reports indicate that there are a number of different versions of NBOMe available - all with differing effects.</li>

    <h2>How are psychedelics used?</h2>
    <br>
        <p>Psychedelics have been used since ancient time by carious cultures throughout the world for their mystical and spiritual associations. LSD, magic mushrooms, Mescaline and DMT are usually swallowed, smoked or inhaled. Mushrooms are usually eaten fresh, cooked, or brewed into a 'tea'.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Occasionally, they may be mixed with tobacco or cannabis and smoked. Mescaline is usually swallowed. Peyote buttons may be ground into a powder and smoked with cannabis or tobacco. The buttons can also be chewed or soaked in water to produce a liquid.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Most forms of NBOMe are inactive if swallowed, and the most common methods of taking them are under the tongue, held in the cheek or snorted.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Generally, people who use psychedelics don't take them on a regular basis, but on occasions that may be weeks or months apart.</p>
