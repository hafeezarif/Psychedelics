    <h2>What exactly are psychedelics?</h2>
    <br>
        <p>Psychedelics are defined to be a class of <span data-descr="affecting the mind">psychoactive</span> substances that produce changes in perception, mood and cognitive processes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Psychedelics affect all the senses, altering someone's thinking, sense of time and emotions. They can also cause a person to hallucinateâ€”seeing or hearing things that do not exist or are distorted.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>How are psychedelics used?</h2>
    <br>
        <p>Psychedelics have been used since ancient time by carious cultures throughout the world for their mystical and spiritual associations. LSD, magic mushrooms, Mescaline and DMT are usually swallowed, smoked or inhaled. Mushrooms are usually eaten fresh, cooked, or brewed into a 'tea'.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Occasionally, they may be mixed with tobacco or cannabis and smoked. Mescaline is usually swallowed. Peyote buttons may be ground into a powder and smoked with cannabis or tobacco. The buttons can also be chewed or soaked in water to produce a liquid.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Most forms of NBOMe are inactive if swallowed, and the most common methods of taking them are under the tongue, held in the cheek or snorted.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Generally, people who use psychedelics don't take them on a regular basis, but on occasions that may be weeks or months apart.</p>
